## ‚ú® Core Features

Walpurgis Bot v2 is built to be a reliable and complete archiving solution:

*   **ü§ñ Automatic Archiving with Integrity**: A dedicated event handler listens to the target user's messages, intelligently validates content with regex, and automatically archives media with an immediate confirmation reaction (‚úÖ).
*   **üõ°Ô∏è Robust Data Integrity**: Features a sophisticated cooldown system to prevent accidental duplicate archives. Logic for out-of-sequence day numbers intelligently prompts for manual intervention, proactively preventing data corruption and ensuring archive accuracy.
*   **üóÑÔ∏è Comprehensive Command Suite**: A full set of slash commands provides complete control over your archives:
    *   **`/search`**: Instantly retrieve and display any day's archived media and metadata.
    *   **`/status`**: Generate a paginated, emoji-coded audit report of archived versus missing days, making it easy to spot gaps.
    *   **`/delete`**: Safely remove an archive with a clear confirmation prompt, preventing accidental data loss.
    *   **`/manual-archive`**: A user-friendly modal workflow to effortlessly archive posts that the automatic system might have missed or that require correction.
*   **üíæ Persistent & Atomic Storage**: All critical data is securely stored in a local SQLite database, ensured persistent in production via a Docker volume. All database operations are atomic and transactional, guaranteeing data consistency even during unexpected events.
*   **üöÄ Blazing Fast Performance**: Leverages the high-speed Bun runtime and an optimized `better-sqlite3` driver for a responsive and fluid user experience.
*   **üèóÔ∏è Scalable & Maintainable Design**: Built with a normalized database schema and a modular, decoupled code structure, allowing the bot to easily grow with new features without requiring extensive refactoring.

The bot is controlled entirely through intuitive Discord slash commands, designed for ease of use and powerful archive management.

### `/search [day]`
Retrieves a specific day's archive, complete with an embed and links.

*   **Description:** Fetches the archived message and media for a given day number.
*   **Parameters:**
    | Parameter | Type    | Required? | Description                          |
    | :-------- | :------ | :-------- | :----------------------------------- |
    | `day`     | Integer | **Yes**   | The day number you want to find (e.g., `150`). |
*   **Example Usage:** `</search day:150>`
*   **Result:** The bot replies with an embed showing the first media attachment, the archive timestamp, and direct links to the original Discord message and any additional media.

### `/status [start] [end]`
Provides a paginated, emoji-coded list showing which days in a range are archived or missing.

*   **Description:** Your powerful tool for auditing the completeness and health of the archive.
*   **Parameters:**
    | Parameter | Type    | Required? | Description                                       |
    | :-------- | :------ | :-------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
    | `start`   | Integer | No        | The first day of the range to check. Defaults to `1`. |
    | `end`     | Integer | No        | The last day of the range. Defaults to the latest day in the archive. |
*   **Example Usage:** `</status start:100 end:150>` or `</status>` for a full audit.
*   **Result:** An ephemeral, paginated embed appears showing `Day 100: ‚úÖ`, `Day 101: ‚ùå`, etc., allowing you to easily identify missing archives. Navigation buttons enable seamless browsing through all pages.

### `/delete [day]`
A safe, confirmation-based command to remove an entry from the archive.

*   **Description:** Prevents accidental data loss by requiring explicit confirmation before deleting any archived day.
*   **Parameters:**
    | Parameter | Type    | Required? | Description                                 |
    | :-------- | :------ | :-------- | :------------------------------------------ |
    | `day`     | Integer | **Yes**   | The day number of the archive to delete. |
*   **Example Usage:** `</delete day:150>`
*   **Result:** The bot sends an ephemeral message with "Yes, Delete" and "No, Cancel" buttons. The deletion only proceeds if explicitly confirmed.

### `/manual-archive [message_id]`
A modal-based workflow for archiving a post that the automatic system missed or needs correction.

*   **Description:** Your primary tool for handling edge cases, correcting mistakes, or backfilling missing archives.
*   **Parameters:**
    | Parameter    | Type   | Required? | Description                                 |
    | :----------- | :----- | :-------- | :------------------------------------------ |

## üöÄ Production Deployment (Docker)

Deploying with Docker is the recommended method for production environments. It provides a consistent, isolated, and auto-restarting setup for maximum reliability.

### Prerequisites
*   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
*   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### 1. `docker-compose.yml`
Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in your desired deployment directory:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  walpurgisbot:
    # Build the image from the Dockerfile in the current directory
    build: .
    container_name: walpurgisbot
    # Ensure the bot automatically restarts unless explicitly stopped
    restart: unless-stopped
    # Load sensitive environment variables from a .env file in the same directory
    env_file:
      - .env
    # Mount a local 'data' directory into the container to persist the SQLite database
    volumes:
      - ./data:/usr/src/app/data
```

> **Note:** This `docker-compose.yml` assumes a `Dockerfile` exists in the same directory, which it does within this project structure.

### 2. Environment Configuration (`.env`)
Create a `.env` file in the **same directory** as your `docker-compose.yml` by copying `.env.example`. **Fill in your own values.**

```env
# Set to 'production' for optimal performance, detailed logging, and error handling
NODE_ENV=production

# --- Discord Bot Credentials (Required) ---
# Your bot's secret token from the Discord Developer Portal (https://discord.com/developers/applications)
TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
# Your bot's application ID (also from the Discord Developer Portal)
CLIENT_ID=your_bot_client_id_here

# --- Application Settings (Required) ---
# The ID of the Discord server (guild) where you want the bot to operate.
# Commands will be registered specifically for this guild.
GUILD_ID=your_target_server_id_here
# The Discord User ID of the specific user whose posts you intend to archive.
JOHAN_USER_ID=the_user_id_to_track_here
```

### 3. Deployment Steps
1.  **Create a data directory:** This local folder will store the SQLite database file, ensuring your archive data persists even if the container is removed or recreated.
    ```bash
    mkdir data
    ```
2.  **Build and run the container:** This command will build the Docker image (if not already built) and start the Walpurgis Bot in the background.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```

### Managing the Bot
*   **View real-time logs:** `docker-compose logs -f walpurgisbot`
*   **Stop the bot:** `docker-compose stop walpurgisbot`
*   **Restart the bot:** `docker-compose restart walpurgisbot`
*   **Take down the container and network (preserves data volume):** `docker-compose down`
*   **Take down the container and remove the data volume:** `docker-compose down -v` (Use with caution!)

## üíª Development Setup

For those who wish to contribute or run the bot locally without Docker for faster iteration.

### Prerequisites
*   [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) (Runtime, Package Manager, Test Runner)

### Steps
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/walpurgisbot-v2.git
    cd walpurgisbot-v2
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```
3.  **Configure environment:** Create a `.env` file by copying `.env.example`. For development, the `GUILD_ID` is **essential** as slash commands are registered per-guild for instant updates, allowing for rapid testing without global propagation delays.
4.  **Deploy slash commands:** Before the first run (and anytime you change a command's definition), you must register them with Discord.
    ```bash
    bun run deploy:commands
    ```
5.  **Start the bot:** Run the bot in development mode, typically with hot-reloading enabled by Bun.
    ```bash
    bun run dev
    ```
6.  **Run tests:**
    ```bash
    bun test
    ```

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture & Design Philosophy

This project is meticulously guided by four fundamental principles, ensuring a robust, maintainable, and high-performance archiving solution. Every architectural decision stems from these core tenets:

1.  **Unyielding Reliability**: The bot's primary function‚Äîarchiving critical data‚Äîdemands absolute reliability. This is achieved through:
    *   **Transactional Database Operations**: Ensuring all-or-nothing data writes, preventing partial or corrupted entries.
    *   **Runtime Data Validation**: Employing **Zod** for strict schema validation of all incoming and outgoing data, catching errors early.
    *   **Structured Logging**: Utilizing **Pino** for comprehensive, context-rich logging, crucial for debugging and operational monitoring.

2.  **Developer-First Maintainability**: A clean, understandable codebase is paramount for long-term sustainability and collaborative development. This is fostered by:
    *   **Strict TypeScript Type Safety**: Eliminating entire classes of bugs at compile time and providing excellent autocompletion.
    *   **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Decoupling components for easier testing, mocking, and isolated development.
    *   **Logical Project Structure**: A clear directory and file organization that naturally guides developers to relevant code.

3.  **Engineered for Scalability**: The architecture is designed to gracefully handle growth, from a single user to many, and from simple features to complex ones. This is enabled by:
    *   **Normalized Database Schema**: Efficiently handles varying numbers of media attachments per post without requiring schema changes or performance degradation.
    *   **Modular Handlers**: New features can be added cleanly as isolated modules, minimizing side effects and complexity.

4.  **Extreme Performance**: Delivering a fast and responsive user experience is a core objective. This is achieved by:
    *   **Bun Runtime**: Leveraging Bun's unparalleled speed for execution and I/O operations.
    *   **High-Performance Database Driver**: Utilizing `better-sqlite3` for native-level SQLite interactions, ensuring minimal overhead.
    *   **Optimized Multi-Stage Docker Images**: Creating lean, efficient production containers that start quickly and consume fewer resources.

### Project Structure
The project is organized with a strict separation of concerns, making navigation and understanding intuitive:
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ commands/           # Each file defines a Discord slash command and its execution logic.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ database/           # Contains the SQLite database connection, schema, and repository for data access.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ events/             # Each file handles a specific Discord client event (e.g., messageCreate, interactionCreate).
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/                # Reusable utility functions and handlers (e.g., command deployment, common logic).
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/              # TypeScript type definitions and Zod schemas for data validation.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.ts           # Centralized environment variable loading and validation.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts            # The application's entry point, handling Discord client initialization and dependency injection.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ logger.ts           # Pino logger configuration for consistent logging across the application.
```
